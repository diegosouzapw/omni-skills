# Knowledge Capture

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `skills/.curated/notion-knowledge-capture` from `https://github.com/openai/skills.git` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Knowledge Capture Convert conversations and notes into structured, linkable Notion pages for easy reuse.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Capture conversations and decisions into structured Notion pages; use when turning chats/notes into wiki entries, how-tos, decisions, or FAQs with proper linking.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Add the Notion MCP:
2. codex mcp add notion --url https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
3. Enable remote MCP client:
4. Set [features].rmcpclient = true in config.toml or run codex --enable rmcpclient
5. Log in with OAuth:
6. codex mcp login notion
7. Ask purpose, audience, freshness, and whether this is new or an update.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Workflow

### 0) If any MCP call fails because Notion MCP is not connected, pause and set it up:
1. Add the Notion MCP:
   - `codex mcp add notion --url https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`
2. Enable remote MCP client:
   - Set `[features].rmcp_client = true` in `config.toml` **or** run `codex --enable rmcp_client`
3. Log in with OAuth:
   - `codex mcp login notion`

After successful login, the user will have to restart codex. You should finish your answer and tell them so when they try again they can continue with Step 1.

### 1) Define the capture
- Ask purpose, audience, freshness, and whether this is new or an update.
- Determine content type: decision, how-to, FAQ, concept/wiki entry, learning/note, documentation page.

### 2) Locate destination
- Pick the correct database using `reference/*-database.md` guides; confirm required properties (title, tags, owner, status, date, relations).
- If multiple candidate databases, ask the user which to use; otherwise, create in the primary wiki/documentation DB.

### 3) Extract and structure
- Extract facts, decisions, actions, and rationale from the conversation.
- For decisions, record alternatives, rationale, and outcomes.
- For how-tos/docs, capture steps, pre-reqs, links to assets/code, and edge cases.
- For FAQs, phrase as Q&A with concise answers and links to deeper docs.

### 4) Create/update in Notion
- Use `Notion:notion-create-pages` with the correct `data_source_id`; set properties (title, tags, owner, status, dates, relations).
- Use templates in `reference/` to structure content (section headers, checklists).
- If updating an existing page, fetch then edit via `Notion:notion-update-page`.

### 5) Link and surface
- Add relations/backlinks to hub pages, related specs/docs, and teams.
- Add a short summary/changelog for future readers.
- If follow-up tasks exist, create tasks in the relevant database and link them.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @notion-knowledge-capture to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/notion-knowledge-capture/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/notion-knowledge-capture/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @notion-knowledge-capture using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick start

1) Clarify what to capture (decision, how-to, FAQ, learning, documentation) and target audience.
2) Identify the right database/template in `reference/` (team wiki, how-to, FAQ, decision log, learning, documentation).
3) Pull any prior context from Notion with `Notion:notion-search` → `Notion:notion-fetch` (existing pages to update/link).
4) Draft the page with `Notion:notion-create-pages` using the database’s schema; include summary, context, source links, and tags/owners.
5) Link from hub pages and related records; update status/owners with `Notion:notion-update-page` as the source evolves.

#### Imported: References and examples

- `reference/` — database schemas and templates (e.g., `team-wiki-database.md`, `how-to-guide-database.md`, `faq-database.md`, `decision-log-database.md`, `documentation-database.md`, `learning-database.md`, `database-best-practices.md`).
- `examples/` — capture patterns in practice (e.g., `decision-capture.md`, `how-to-guide.md`, `conversation-to-faq.md`).

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `skills/.curated/notion-knowledge-capture`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
