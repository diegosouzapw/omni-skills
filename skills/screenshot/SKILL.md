# Screenshot Capture

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `skills/.curated/screenshot` from `https://github.com/openai/skills.git` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Screenshot Capture Follow these save-location rules every time: 1) If the user specifies a path, save there. 2) If the user asks for a screenshot without a path, save to the OS default screenshot location. 3) If Codex needs a screenshot for its own inspection, save to the temp directory.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Tool priority, macOS permission preflight (reduce repeated prompts), macOS and Linux (Python helper), Windows (PowerShell helper), Error handling.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: the user explicitly asks for a desktop or system screenshot (full screen, specific app or window, or a pixel region), or when tool-specific capture capabilities are unavailable and an OS-level capture is needed.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the checklist, rubric, and expected evidence for the task.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Tool priority

- Prefer tool-specific screenshot capabilities when available (for example: a Figma MCP/skill for Figma files, or Playwright/agent-browser tools for browsers and Electron apps).
- Use this skill when explicitly asked, for whole-system desktop captures, or when a tool-specific capture cannot get what you need.
- Otherwise, treat this skill as the default for desktop apps without a better-integrated capture tool.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @screenshot to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/screenshot/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/screenshot/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @screenshot using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Direct OS commands (fallbacks)

Use these when you cannot run the helpers.

### macOS

- Full screen to a specific path:

```bash
screencapture -x output/screen.png
```

- Pixel region:

```bash
screencapture -x -R100,200,800,600 output/region.png
```

- Specific window id:

```bash
screencapture -x -l12345 output/window.png
```

- Interactive selection or window pick:

```bash
screencapture -x -i output/interactive.png
```

### Linux

- Full screen:

```bash
scrot output/screen.png
```

```bash
gnome-screenshot -f output/screen.png
```

```bash
import -window root output/screen.png
```

- Pixel region:

```bash
scrot -a 100,200,800,600 output/region.png
```

```bash
import -window root -crop 800x600+100+200 output/region.png
```

- Active window:

```bash
scrot -u output/window.png
```

```bash
gnome-screenshot -w -f output/window.png
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `skills/.curated/screenshot`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: macOS permission preflight (reduce repeated prompts)

On macOS, run the preflight helper once before window/app capture. It checks
Screen Recording permission, explains why it is needed, and requests it in one
place.

The helpers route Swift's module cache to `$TMPDIR/codex-swift-module-cache`
to avoid extra sandbox module-cache prompts.

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/ensure_macos_permissions.sh
```

To avoid multiple sandbox approval prompts, combine preflight + capture in one
command when possible:

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/ensure_macos_permissions.sh && \
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --app "Codex"
```

For Codex inspection runs, keep the output in temp:

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/ensure_macos_permissions.sh && \
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --app "<App>" --mode temp
```

Use the bundled scripts to avoid re-deriving OS-specific commands.

#### Imported: macOS and Linux (Python helper)

Run the helper from the repo root:

```bash
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py
```

Common patterns:

- Default location (user asked for "a screenshot"):

```bash
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py
```

- Temp location (Codex visual check):

```bash
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --mode temp
```

- Explicit location (user provided a path or filename):

```bash
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --path output/screen.png
```

- App/window capture by app name (macOS only; substring match is OK; captures all matching windows):

```bash
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --app "Codex"
```

- Specific window title within an app (macOS only):

```bash
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --app "Codex" --window-name "Settings"
```

- List matching window ids before capturing (macOS only):

```bash
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --list-windows --app "Codex"
```

- Pixel region (x,y,w,h):

```bash
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --mode temp --region 100,200,800,600
```

- Focused/active window (captures only the frontmost window; use `--app` to capture all windows):

```bash
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --mode temp --active-window
```

- Specific window id (use --list-windows on macOS to discover ids):

```bash
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --window-id 12345
```

The script prints one path per capture. When multiple windows or displays match, it prints multiple paths (one per line) and adds suffixes like `-w<windowId>` or `-d<display>`. View each path sequentially with the image viewer tool, and only manipulate images if needed or requested.

### Workflow examples

- "Take a look at <App> and tell me what you see": capture to temp, then view each printed path in order.

```bash
bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/ensure_macos_permissions.sh && \
python3 <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.py --app "<App>" --mode temp
```

- "The design from Figma is not matching what is implemented": use a Figma MCP/skill to capture the design first, then capture the running app with this skill (typically to temp) and compare the raw screenshots before any manipulation.

### Multi-display behavior

- On macOS, full-screen captures save one file per display when multiple monitors are connected.
- On Linux and Windows, full-screen captures use the virtual desktop (all monitors in one image); use `--region` to isolate a single display when needed.

### Linux prerequisites and selection logic

The helper automatically selects the first available tool:

1) `scrot`
2) `gnome-screenshot`
3) ImageMagick `import`

If none are available, ask the user to install one of them and retry.

Coordinate regions require `scrot` or ImageMagick `import`.

`--app`, `--window-name`, and `--list-windows` are macOS-only. On Linux, use
`--active-window` or provide `--window-id` when available.

#### Imported: Windows (PowerShell helper)

Run the PowerShell helper:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1
```

Common patterns:

- Default location:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1
```

- Temp location (Codex visual check):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1 -Mode temp
```

- Explicit path:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1 -Path "C:\Temp\screen.png"
```

- Pixel region (x,y,w,h):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1 -Mode temp -Region 100,200,800,600
```

- Active window (ask the user to focus it first):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1 -Mode temp -ActiveWindow
```

- Specific window handle (only when provided):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <path-to-skill>/scripts/take_screenshot.ps1 -WindowHandle 123456
```

#### Imported: Error handling

- On macOS, run `bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/ensure_macos_permissions.sh` first to request Screen Recording in one place.
- If you see "screen capture checks are blocked in the sandbox", "could not create image from display", or Swift `ModuleCache` permission errors in a sandboxed run, rerun the command with escalated permissions.
- If macOS app/window capture returns no matches, run `--list-windows --app "AppName"` and retry with `--window-id`, and make sure the app is visible on screen.
- If Linux region/window capture fails, check tool availability with `command -v scrot`, `command -v gnome-screenshot`, and `command -v import`.
- If saving to the OS default location fails with permission errors in a sandbox, rerun the command with escalated permissions.
- Always report the saved file path in the response.
