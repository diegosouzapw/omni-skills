# Create Design System Rules

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `skills/.curated/figma-create-design-system-rules` from `https://github.com/openai/skills.git` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Create Design System Rules

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Prerequisites, Asset Handling, Project-Specific Conventions, Component Organization, Figma Implementation Flow, Component Organization.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Starting a new project that will use Figma designs
- Onboarding an AI coding agent to an existing project with established patterns
- Standardizing Figma-to-code workflows across your team
- Updating or refining existing design system conventions
- Users explicitly request: "create design system rules", "set up Figma guidelines", "customize rules for my project"
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Generates custom design system rules for the user's codebase. Use when user says "create design system rules", "generate rules for my project", "set up design rules", "customize design system guidelines", or wants to....

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. clientLanguages: Comma-separated list of languages used in the project (e.g., "typescript,javascript", "python", "javascript")
2. clientFrameworks: Framework being used (e.g., "react", "vue", "svelte", "angular", "unknown")
3. Where are UI components located? (e.g., src/components/, app/ui/, lib/components/)
4. Is there a dedicated design system directory?
5. How are components organized? (by feature, by type, flat structure)
6. What CSS framework or approach is used? (Tailwind, CSS Modules, styled-components, etc.)
7. Where are design tokens defined? (CSS variables, theme files, config files)

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Required Workflow

**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.**

### Step 1: Run the Create Design System Rules Tool

Call the Figma MCP server's `create_design_system_rules` tool to get the foundational prompt and template.

**Parameters:**

- `clientLanguages`: Comma-separated list of languages used in the project (e.g., "typescript,javascript", "python", "javascript")
- `clientFrameworks`: Framework being used (e.g., "react", "vue", "svelte", "angular", "unknown")

This tool returns guidance and a template for creating design system rules.

Structure your design system rules following the template format provided in the tool's response.

### Step 2: Analyze the Codebase

Before finalizing rules, analyze the project to understand existing patterns:

**Component Organization:**

- Where are UI components located? (e.g., `src/components/`, `app/ui/`, `lib/components/`)
- Is there a dedicated design system directory?
- How are components organized? (by feature, by type, flat structure)

**Styling Approach:**

- What CSS framework or approach is used? (Tailwind, CSS Modules, styled-components, etc.)
- Where are design tokens defined? (CSS variables, theme files, config files)
- Are there existing color, typography, or spacing tokens?

**Component Patterns:**

- What naming conventions are used? (PascalCase, kebab-case, prefixes)
- How are component props typically structured?
- Are there common composition patterns?

**Architecture Decisions:**

- How is state management handled?
- What routing system is used?
- Are there specific import patterns or path aliases?

### Step 3: Generate Project-Specific Rules

Based on your codebase analysis, create a comprehensive set of rules. Include:

#### General Component Rules

```markdown
- IMPORTANT: Always use components from `[YOUR_PATH]` when possible
- Place new UI components in `[COMPONENT_DIRECTORY]`
- Follow `[NAMING_CONVENTION]` for component names
- Components must export as `[EXPORT_PATTERN]`
```

#### Styling Rules

```markdown
- Use `[CSS_FRAMEWORK/APPROACH]` for styling
- Design tokens are defined in `[TOKEN_LOCATION]`
- IMPORTANT: Never hardcode colors - always use tokens from `[TOKEN_FILE]`
- Spacing values must use the `[SPACING_SYSTEM]` scale
- Typography follows the scale defined in `[TYPOGRAPHY_LOCATION]`
```

#### Figma MCP Integration Rules

```markdown

#### Imported: Overview

This skill helps you generate custom design system rules tailored to your project's specific needs. These rules guide AI coding agents to produce consistent, high-quality code when implementing Figma designs, ensuring that your team's conventions, component patterns, and architectural decisions are followed automatically.

### Supported Rule Files

| Agent | Rule File |
|-------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/figma-design-system.mdc` |

#### Imported: Prerequisites

- Figma MCP server must be connected and accessible
- Access to the project codebase for analysis
- Understanding of your team's component conventions (or willingness to establish them)

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @figma-create-design-system-rules to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/figma-create-design-system-rules/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/figma-create-design-system-rules/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @figma-create-design-system-rules using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Rule Categories and Examples

### Essential Rules (Always Include)

**Component Discovery:**

```markdown
- UI components are located in `src/components/ui/`
- Feature components are in `src/components/features/`
- Layout primitives are in `src/components/layout/`
```

**Design Token Usage:**

```markdown
- Colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/styles/tokens.css`
- Never hardcode hex colors - use `var(--color-*)` tokens
- Spacing uses the 4px base scale: `--space-1` (4px), `--space-2` (8px), etc.
```

**Styling Approach:**

```markdown
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Custom styles go in component-level CSS modules
- Theme customization is in `tailwind.config.js`
```

### Recommended Rules (Highly Valuable)

**Component Patterns:**

```markdown
- All components must accept a `className` prop for composition
- Variant props should use union types: `variant: 'primary' | 'secondary'`
- Icon components should accept `size` and `color` props
```

**Import Conventions:**

```markdown
- Use path aliases: `@/components`, `@/styles`, `@/utils`
- Group imports: React, third-party, internal, types
- No relative imports beyond parent directory
```

**Code Quality:**

```markdown
- Add JSDoc comments for exported components
- Include PropTypes or TypeScript types for all props
- Extract magic numbers to named constants
```

### Optional Rules (Project-Specific)

**Accessibility:**

```markdown
- All interactive elements must have aria-labels
- Color contrast must meet WCAG AA standards
- Keyboard navigation required for all interactions
```

**Performance:**

```markdown
- Lazy load images with the `Image` component from `@/components/Image`
- Use React.memo for components that receive complex props
- Icons should be SVG components, not icon fonts
```

**Testing:**

```markdown
- Include unit tests for new components in `__tests__/` directory
- Use Testing Library queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)
- Test all interactive states and variants
```

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: React + Tailwind Project

User says: "Create design system rules for my React project"

**Actions:**

1. Run `create_design_system_rules(clientLanguages="typescript,javascript", clientFrameworks="react")`
2. Analyze codebase structure
3. Generate rules:

```markdown
# Figma MCP Integration Rules

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Which layout primitives and components to use
- Where component files should be located
- How components should be named and structured
- What should never be hardcoded
- How to handle design tokens and styling
- Project-specific architectural patterns
- Run getdesigncontext first to fetch the structured representation for the exact node(s)

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: What Are Design System Rules?

Design system rules are project-level instructions that encode the "unwritten knowledge" of your codebase - the kind of expertise that experienced developers know and would pass on to new team members:

- Which layout primitives and components to use
- Where component files should be located
- How components should be named and structured
- What should never be hardcoded
- How to handle design tokens and styling
- Project-specific architectural patterns

Once defined, these rules dramatically reduce repetitive prompting and ensure consistent output across all Figma implementation tasks.

#### Imported: Figma MCP Integration Rules

These rules define how to translate Figma inputs into code for this project and must be followed for every Figma-driven change.

### Required Flow (do not skip)

1. Run get_design_context first to fetch the structured representation for the exact node(s)
2. If the response is too large or truncated, run get_metadata to get the high-level node map, then re-fetch only the required node(s) with get_design_context
3. Run get_screenshot for a visual reference of the node variant being implemented
4. Only after you have both get_design_context and get_screenshot, download any assets needed and start implementation
5. Translate the output (usually React + Tailwind) into this project's conventions, styles, and framework
6. Validate against Figma for 1:1 look and behavior before marking complete

### Implementation Rules

- Treat the Figma MCP output (React + Tailwind) as a representation of design and behavior, not as final code style
- Replace Tailwind utility classes with `[YOUR_STYLING_APPROACH]` when applicable
- Reuse existing components from `[COMPONENT_PATH]` instead of duplicating functionality
- Use the project's color system, typography scale, and spacing tokens consistently
- Respect existing routing, state management, and data-fetch patterns
- Strive for 1:1 visual parity with the Figma design
- Validate the final UI against the Figma screenshot for both look and behavior
```

#### Asset Handling Rules

```markdown

#### Imported: Styling Rules

- IMPORTANT: Use Tailwind utility classes, not inline styles
- Colors are defined in `tailwind.config.js` theme.colors
- Spacing uses Tailwind's default scale
- Custom components go in `src/components/ui/`

#### Imported: Asset Rules

- IMPORTANT: Use localhost sources from Figma MCP server directly
- Store static assets in `public/assets/`
- DO NOT install new icon libraries
```

4. Save to the appropriate rule file for the user's agent
5. Test with a simple button implementation

**Result:** The agent now consistently follows the project's conventions when implementing Figma designs.

### Example 2: Vue + Custom CSS Project

User says: "Set up Figma rules for my Vue app"

**Actions:**

1. Run `create_design_system_rules(clientLanguages="typescript,javascript", clientFrameworks="vue")`
2. Discover that project uses CSS modules and a custom design token system
3. Generate rules:

```markdown
# Figma MCP Integration Rules

#### Imported: Styling Rules

- Use CSS Modules (`.module.css` files)
- IMPORTANT: Reference design tokens, never hardcode values
- Scoped styles with CSS modules
```

4. Save to the appropriate rule file for the user's agent
5. Validate with a card component

**Result:** The agent now correctly translates Figma designs to Vue components using the project's design token system.

### Example 3: Design System Team

User says: "Generate rules for our design system library"

**Actions:**

1. Run `create_design_system_rules(clientLanguages="typescript", clientFrameworks="react")`
2. Analyze the monorepo structure with design system package
3. Generate comprehensive rules:

```markdown
# Design System Rules

#### Imported: Best Practices

### Start Simple, Iterate

Don't try to capture every rule upfront. Start with the most important conventions and add rules as you encounter inconsistencies.

### Be Specific

Instead of: "Use the design system"
Write: "Always use Button components from `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` with variant prop ('primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost')"

### Make Rules Actionable

Each rule should tell the agent exactly what to do, not just what to avoid.

Good: "Colors are defined in `src/theme/colors.ts` - import and use these constants"
Bad: "Don't hardcode colors"

### Use IMPORTANT for Critical Rules

Prefix rules that must never be violated with "IMPORTANT:" to ensure the agent prioritizes them.

```markdown
- IMPORTANT: Never expose API keys in client-side code
- IMPORTANT: Always sanitize user input before rendering
```

### Document the Why

When rules seem arbitrary, explain the reasoning:

```markdown
- Place all data-fetching in server components (reduces client bundle size and improves performance)
- Use absolute imports with `@/` alias (makes refactoring easier and prevents broken relative paths)
```

#### Imported: Understanding Design System Rules

Design system rules transform how AI coding agents work with your Figma designs:

**Before rules:**

- The agent makes assumptions about component structure
- Inconsistent styling approaches across implementations
- Hardcoded values that don't match design tokens
- Components created in random locations
- Repetitive explanations of project conventions

**After rules:**

- The agent automatically follows your conventions
- Consistent component structure and styling
- Proper use of design tokens from the start
- Components organized correctly
- Zero repetitive prompting

The time invested in creating good rules pays off exponentially across every Figma implementation task.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `skills/.curated/figma-create-design-system-rules`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Step 4: Save Rules to the Appropriate Rule File

Detect which AI coding agent the user is working with and save the generated rules to the corresponding file:

| Agent | Rule File | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` in project root | Markdown format. Can also use `.claude/rules/figma-design-system.md` for modular organization. |
| Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` in project root | Markdown format. Append as a new section if file already exists. 32 KiB combined size limit. |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/figma-design-system.mdc` | Markdown with YAML frontmatter (`description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`). |

If unsure which agent the user is working with, check for existing rule files in the project or ask the user.

For Cursor, wrap the rules with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: Rules for implementing Figma designs using the Figma MCP server. Covers component organization, styling conventions, design tokens, asset handling, and the required Figma-to-code workflow.
globs: "src/components/**"
alwaysApply: false
---

[Generated rules here]
```

Customize the `globs` pattern to match the directories where Figma-derived code will live in the project (e.g., `"src/**/*.tsx"` or `["src/components/**", "src/pages/**"]`).

After saving, the rules will be automatically loaded by the agent and applied to all Figma implementation tasks.

### Step 5: Validate and Iterate

After creating rules:

1. Test with a simple Figma component implementation
2. Verify the agent follows the rules correctly
3. Refine any rules that aren't working as expected
4. Share with team members for feedback
5. Update rules as the project evolves

#### Imported: Component Organization

- Design tokens: `packages/tokens/src/`

#### Imported: Component Development

- IMPORTANT: All components must be in `packages/design-system/src/components/`
- Component file structure: `ComponentName/index.tsx`, `ComponentName.stories.tsx`, `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- Export all components from `packages/design-system/src/index.ts`

#### Imported: Design Tokens

- Colors: `packages/tokens/src/colors.ts`
- Typography: `packages/tokens/src/typography.ts`

- Include JSDoc with @example
- Document all props with descriptions
- Add accessibility notes

#### Imported: Figma Integration

1. Get design context and screenshot from Figma
2. Map Figma tokens to design system tokens
3. Create or extend component in design system package
4. Add Storybook stories showing all variants
5. Validate against Figma screenshot
6. Update documentation
```

4. Save to the appropriate rule file and share with team
5. Add to team documentation

**Result:** Entire team follows consistent patterns when adding components from Figma to the design system.

#### Imported: Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: The agent isn't following the rules

**Cause:** Rules may be too vague or not properly loaded by the agent.
**Solution:**

- Make rules more specific and actionable
- Verify rules are saved in the correct configuration file
- Restart your agent or IDE to reload rules
- Add "IMPORTANT:" prefix to critical rules

### Issue: Rules conflict with each other

**Cause:** Contradictory or overlapping rules.
**Solution:**

- Review all rules for conflicts
- Establish a clear priority hierarchy
- Remove redundant rules
- Consolidate related rules into single, clear statements

### Issue: Too many rules increase latency

**Cause:** Excessive rules increase context size and processing time.
**Solution:**

- Focus on the 20% of rules that solve 80% of consistency issues
- Remove overly specific rules that rarely apply
- Combine related rules
- Use progressive disclosure (basic rules first, advanced rules in linked files)

### Issue: Rules become outdated as project evolves

**Cause:** Codebase changes but rules don't.
**Solution:**

- Schedule periodic rule reviews (monthly or quarterly)
- Update rules when architectural decisions change
- Version control your rule files
- Document rule changes in commit messages
