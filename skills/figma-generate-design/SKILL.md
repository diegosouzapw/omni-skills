# Build / Update Screens from Design System

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `skills/.curated/figma-generate-design` from `https://github.com/openai/skills.git` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Build / Update Screens from Design System Use this skill to create or update full-page screens in Figma by reusing the published design system — components, variables, and styles — rather than drawing primitives with hardcoded values. The key insight: the Figma file likely has a published design system with components, color/spacing variables, and text/effect styles that correspond to the codebase's UI components and tokens. Find and use those instead of drawing boxes with hex colors. MANDATORY: You MUST also load figma-use before any usefigma call. That skill contains critical rules (color ranges, font loading, etc.) that apply to every script you write. Always pass skillNames: "figma-generate-design" when calling usefigma as part of this skill. This is a logging parameter — it does not affect execution.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Skill Boundaries, Prerequisites, Error Recovery.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Use this skill alongside figma-use when the task involves translating an application page, view, or multi-section layout into Figma. Triggers: 'write to Figma', 'create in Figma from code', 'push page to Figma', 'take....
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. In parallel:
2. Start building the screen using this skill's workflow (use_figma + design system components)
3. Run generatefigmadesign to capture a pixel-perfect screenshot of the running web app
4. Once both complete: Update the usefigma output to match the pixel-perfect layout from the generatefigmadesign capture. The capture provides the exact spacing, sizing, and visual treatment to aim for, while your usefigma output has proper component instances linked to the design system.
5. Once confirmed looking good: Delete the generatefigmadesign output — it was only used as a visual reference.
6. If building from code, read the relevant source files to understand the page structure, sections, and which components are used.
7. Identify the major sections of the screen (e.g., Header, Hero, Content Panels, Pricing Grid, FAQ Accordion, Footer).

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Parallel Workflow with generate_figma_design (Web Apps Only)

When building a screen from a **web app** that can be rendered in a browser, the best results come from running both approaches in parallel:

1. **In parallel:**
   - Start building the screen using this skill's workflow (use_figma + design system components)
   - Run `generate_figma_design` to capture a pixel-perfect screenshot of the running web app
2. **Once both complete:** Update the use_figma output to match the pixel-perfect layout from the `generate_figma_design` capture. The capture provides the exact spacing, sizing, and visual treatment to aim for, while your use_figma output has proper component instances linked to the design system.
3. **Once confirmed looking good:** Delete the `generate_figma_design` output — it was only used as a visual reference.

This combines the best of both: `generate_figma_design` gives pixel-perfect layout accuracy, while use_figma gives proper design system component instances that stay linked and updatable.

**This workflow only applies to web apps** where `generate_figma_design` can capture the running page. For non-web apps (iOS, Android, etc.) or when updating existing screens, use the standard workflow below.

#### Imported: Required Workflow

**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.**

### Step 1: Understand the Screen

Before touching Figma, understand what you're building:

1. If building from code, read the relevant source files to understand the page structure, sections, and which components are used.
2. Identify the major sections of the screen (e.g., Header, Hero, Content Panels, Pricing Grid, FAQ Accordion, Footer).
3. For each section, list the UI components involved (buttons, inputs, cards, navigation pills, accordions, etc.).

### Step 2: Discover Design System — Components, Variables, and Styles

You need three things from the design system: **components** (buttons, cards, etc.), **variables** (colors, spacing, radii), and **styles** (text styles, effect styles like shadows). Don't hardcode hex colors or pixel values when design system tokens exist.

#### 2a: Discover components

**Preferred: inspect existing screens first.** If the target file already contains screens using the same design system, skip `search_design_system` and inspect existing instances directly. A single `use_figma` call that walks an existing frame's instances gives you an exact, authoritative component map:

```js
const frame = figma.currentPage.findOne(n => n.name === "Existing Screen");
const uniqueSets = new Map();
frame.findAll(n => n.type === "INSTANCE").forEach(inst => {
  const mc = inst.mainComponent;
  const cs = mc?.parent?.type === "COMPONENT_SET" ? mc.parent : null;
  const key = cs ? cs.key : mc?.key;
  const name = cs ? cs.name : mc?.name;
  if (key && !uniqueSets.has(key)) {
    uniqueSets.set(key, { name, key, isSet: !!cs, sampleVariant: mc.name });
  }
});
return [...uniqueSets.values()];
```

Only fall back to `search_design_system` when the file has no existing screens to reference. When using it, **search broadly** — try multiple terms and synonyms (e.g., "button", "input", "nav", "card", "accordion", "header", "footer", "tag", "avatar", "toggle", "icon", etc.). Use `includeComponents: true` to focus on components.

**Include component properties** in your map — you need to know which TEXT properties each component exposes for text overrides. Create a temporary instance, read its `componentProperties` (and those of nested instances), then remove the temp instance.

Example component map with property info:

```
Component Map:
- Button → key: "abc123", type: COMPONENT_SET
  Properties: { "Label#2:0": TEXT, "Has Icon#4:64": BOOLEAN }
- PricingCard → key: "ghi789", type: COMPONENT_SET
  Properties: { "Device": VARIANT, "Variant": VARIANT }
  Nested "Text Heading" has: { "Text#2104:5": TEXT }
  Nested "Button" has: { "Label#2:0": TEXT }
```

#### 2b: Discover variables (colors, spacing, radii)

**Inspect existing screens first** (same as components). Or use `search_design_system` with `includeVariables: true`.

> **WARNING: Two different variable discovery methods — do not confuse them.**
>
> - `use_figma` with `figma.variables.getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync()` — returns **only local variables defined in the current file**. If this returns empty, it does **not** mean no variables exist. Remote/published library variables are invisible to this API.
> - `search_design_system` with `includeVariables: true` — searches across **all linked libraries**, including remote and published ones. This is the correct tool for discovering design system variables.
>
> **Never conclude "no variables exist" based solely on `getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync()` returning empty.** Always also run `search_design_system` with `includeVariables: true` to check for library variables before deciding to create your own.

**Query strategy:** `search_design_system` matches against **variable names** (e.g., "Gray/gray-9", "core/gray/100", "space/400"), not categories. Run multiple short, simple queries in parallel rather than one compound query:

- **Primitive colors:** "gray", "red", "blue", "green", "white", "brand"
- **Semantic colors:** "background", "foreground", "border", "surface", "text"
- **Spacing/sizing:** "space", "radius", "gap", "padding"

If initial searches return empty, try shorter fragments or different naming conventions — libraries vary widely ("grey" vs "gray", "spacing" vs "space", "color/bg" vs "background").

Inspect an existing screen's bound variables for the most authoritative results:

```js
const frame = figma.currentPage.findOne(n => n.name === "Existing Screen");
const varMap = new Map();
frame.findAll(() => true).forEach(node => {
  const bv = node.boundVariables;
  if (!bv) return;
  for (const [prop, binding] of Object.entries(bv)) {
    const bindings = Array.isArray(binding) ? binding : [binding];
    for (const b of bindings) {
      if (b?.id && !varMap.has(b.id)) {
        const v = await figma.variables.getVariableByIdAsync(b.id);
        if (v) varMap.set(b.id, { name: v.name, id: v.id, key: v.key, type: v.resolvedType, remote: v.remote });
      }
    }
  }
});
return [...varMap.values()];
```

For library variables (remote = true), import them by key with `figma.variables.importVariableByKeyAsync(key)`. For local variables, use `figma.variables.getVariableByIdAsync(id)` directly.

See [variable-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/variable-patterns.md) for binding patterns.

#### 2c: Discover styles (text styles, effect styles)

Search for styles using `search_design_system` with `includeStyles: true` and terms like "heading", "body", "shadow", "elevation". Or inspect what an existing screen uses:

```js
const frame = figma.currentPage.findOne(n => n.name === "Existing Screen");
const styles = { text: new Map(), effect: new Map() };
frame.findAll(() => true).forEach(node => {
  if ('textStyleId' in node && node.textStyleId) {
    const s = figma.getStyleById(node.textStyleId);
    if (s) styles.text.set(s.id, { name: s.name, id: s.id, key: s.key });
  }
  if ('effectStyleId' in node && node.effectStyleId) {
    const s = figma.getStyleById(node.effectStyleId);
    if (s) styles.effect.set(s.id, { name: s.name, id: s.id, key: s.key });
  }
});
return {
  textStyles: [...styles.text.values()],
  effectStyles: [...styles.effect.values()]
};
```

Import library styles with `figma.importStyleByKeyAsync(key)`, then apply with `node.textStyleId = style.id` or `node.effectStyleId = style.id`.

See [text-style-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/text-style-patterns.md) and [effect-style-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/effect-style-patterns.md) for details.

### Step 3: Create the Page Wrapper Frame First

**Do NOT build sections as top-level page children and reparent them later** — moving nodes across `use_figma` calls with `appendChild()` silently fails and produces orphaned frames. Instead, create the wrapper first, then build each section directly inside it.

Create the page wrapper in its own `use_figma` call. Position it away from existing content and return its ID:

```js
// Find clear space
let maxX = 0;
for (const child of figma.currentPage.children) {
  maxX = Math.max(maxX, child.x + child.width);
}

const wrapper = figma.createFrame();
wrapper.name = "Homepage";
wrapper.layoutMode = "VERTICAL";
wrapper.primaryAxisAlignItems = "CENTER";
wrapper.counterAxisAlignItems = "CENTER";
wrapper.resize(1440, 100);
wrapper.layoutSizingHorizontal = "FIXED";
wrapper.layoutSizingVertical = "HUG";
wrapper.x = maxX + 200;
wrapper.y = 0;

return { success: true, wrapperId: wrapper.id };
```

### Step 4: Build Each Section Inside the Wrapper

**This is the most important step.** Build one section at a time, each in its own `use_figma` call. At the start of each script, fetch the wrapper by ID and append new content directly to it.

```js
const createdNodeIds = [];
const wrapper = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("WRAPPER_ID_FROM_STEP_3");

// Import design system components by key
const buttonSet = await figma.importComponentSetByKeyAsync("BUTTON_SET_KEY");
const primaryButton = buttonSet.children.find(c =>
  c.type === "COMPONENT" && c.name.includes("variant=primary")
) || buttonSet.defaultVariant;

// Import design system variables for colors and spacing
const bgColorVar = await figma.variables.importVariableByKeyAsync("BG_COLOR_VAR_KEY");
const spacingVar = await figma.variables.importVariableByKeyAsync("SPACING_VAR_KEY");

// Build section frame with variable bindings (not hardcoded values)
const section = figma.createFrame();
section.name = "Header";
section.layoutMode = "HORIZONTAL";
section.setBoundVariable("paddingLeft", spacingVar);
section.setBoundVariable("paddingRight", spacingVar);
const bgPaint = figma.variables.setBoundVariableForPaint(
  { type: 'SOLID', color: { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0 } }, 'color', bgColorVar
);
section.fills = [bgPaint];

// Import and apply text/effect styles
const shadowStyle = await figma.importStyleByKeyAsync("SHADOW_STYLE_KEY");
section.effectStyleId = shadowStyle.id;

// Create component instances inside the section
const btnInstance = primaryButton.createInstance();
section.appendChild(btnInstance);
createdNodeIds.push(btnInstance.id);

// Append section to wrapper
wrapper.appendChild(section);
section.layoutSizingHorizontal = "FILL"; // AFTER appending

createdNodeIds.push(section.id);
return { success: true, createdNodeIds };
```

After each section, validate with `get_screenshot` before moving on. Look closely for cropped/clipped text (line heights cutting off content) and overlapping elements — these are the most common issues and easy to miss at a glance.

#### Override instance text with setProperties()

Component instances ship with placeholder text ("Title", "Heading", "Button"). Use the component property keys you discovered in Step 2 to override them with `setProperties()` — this is more reliable than direct `node.characters` manipulation. See [component-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/component-patterns.md#overriding-text-in-a-component-instance) for the full pattern.

For nested instances that expose their own TEXT properties, call `setProperties()` on the nested instance:

```js
const nestedHeading = cardInstance.findOne(n => n.type === "INSTANCE" && n.name === "Text Heading");
if (nestedHeading) {
  nestedHeading.setProperties({ "Text#2104:5": "Actual heading from source code" });
}
```

Only fall back to direct `node.characters` for text that is NOT managed by any component property.

#### Read source code defaults carefully

When translating code components to Figma instances, check the component's default prop values in the source code, not just what's explicitly passed. For example, `<Button size="small">Register</Button>` with no variant prop — check the component definition to find `variant = "primary"` as the default. Selecting the wrong variant (e.g., Neutral instead of Primary) produces a visually incorrect result that's easy to miss.

#### What to build manually vs. import from design system

| Build manually | Import from design system |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Page wrapper frame | **Components**: buttons, cards, inputs, nav, etc. |
| Section container frames | **Variables**: colors (fills, strokes), spacing (padding, gap), radii |
| Layout grids (rows, columns) | **Text styles**: heading, body, caption, etc. |
| | **Effect styles**: shadows, blurs, etc. |

**Never hardcode hex colors or pixel spacing** when a design system variable exists. Use `setBoundVariable` for spacing/radii and `setBoundVariableForPaint` for colors. Apply text styles with `node.textStyleId` and effect styles with `node.effectStyleId`.

### Step 5: Validate the Full Screen

After composing all sections, call `get_screenshot` on the full page frame and compare against the source. Fix any issues with targeted `use_figma` calls — don't rebuild the entire screen.

**Screenshot individual sections, not just the full page.** A full-page screenshot at reduced resolution hides text truncation, wrong colors, and placeholder text that hasn't been overridden. Take a screenshot of each section by node ID to catch:
- **Cropped/clipped text** — line heights or frame sizing cutting off descenders, ascenders, or entire lines
- **Overlapping content** — elements stacking on top of each other due to incorrect sizing or missing auto-layout
- Placeholder text still showing ("Title", "Heading", "Button")
- Truncated content from layout sizing bugs
- Wrong component variants (e.g., Neutral vs Primary button)

### Step 6: Updating an Existing Screen

When updating rather than creating from scratch:

1. Use `get_metadata` to inspect the existing screen structure.
2. Identify which sections need updating and which can stay.
3. For each section that needs changes:
   - Locate the existing nodes by ID or name
   - Swap component instances if the design system component changed
   - Update text content, variant properties, or layout as needed
   - Remove deprecated sections
   - Add new sections
4. Validate with `get_screenshot` after each modification.

```js
// Example: Swap a button variant in an existing screen
const existingButton = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("EXISTING_BUTTON_INSTANCE_ID");
if (existingButton && existingButton.type === "INSTANCE") {
  // Import the updated component
  const buttonSet = await figma.importComponentSetByKeyAsync("BUTTON_SET_KEY");
  const newVariant = buttonSet.children.find(c =>
    c.name.includes("variant=primary") && c.name.includes("size=lg")
  ) || buttonSet.defaultVariant;
  existingButton.swapComponent(newVariant);
}
return { success: true, mutatedNodeIds: [existingButton.id] };
```

#### Imported: Skill Boundaries

- Use this skill when the deliverable is a **Figma screen** (new or updated) composed of design system component instances.
- If the user wants to generate **code from a Figma design**, switch to [figma-implement-design](../figma-implement-design/SKILL.md).
- If the user wants to create **new reusable components or variants**, use [figma-use](../figma-use/SKILL.md) directly.
- If the user wants to write **Code Connect mappings**, switch to [figma-code-connect-components](../figma-code-connect-components/SKILL.md).

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @figma-generate-design to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/figma-generate-design/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/figma-generate-design/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @figma-generate-design using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Always search before building. The design system likely has the component, variable, or style you need. Manual construction and hardcoded values should be the exception, not the rule.
- Search broadly. Try synonyms and partial terms. A "NavigationPill" might be found under "pill", "nav", "tab", or "chip". For variables, search "color", "spacing", "radius", etc.
- Prefer design system tokens over hardcoded values. Use variable bindings for colors, spacing, and radii. Use text styles for typography. Use effect styles for shadows. This keeps the screen linked to the design system.
- Prefer component instances over manual builds. Instances stay linked to the source component and update automatically when the design system evolves.
- Work section by section. Never build more than one major section per use_figma call.
- Return node IDs from every call. You'll need them to compose sections and for error recovery.
- Validate visually after each section. Use get_screenshot to catch issues early.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `skills/.curated/figma-generate-design`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Reference Docs

For detailed API patterns and gotchas, load these from the [figma-use](../figma-use/SKILL.md) references as needed:

- [component-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/component-patterns.md) — importing by key, finding variants, setProperties, text overrides, working with instances
- [variable-patterns.md](../figma-use/references/variable-patterns.md) — creating/binding variables, importing library variables, scopes, aliasing, discovering existing variables

- [gotchas.md](../figma-use/references/gotchas.md) — layout pitfalls (HUG/FILL interactions, counterAxisAlignItems, sizing order), paint/color issues, page context resets

#### Imported: Prerequisites

- Figma MCP server must be connected
- The target Figma file must have a published design system with components (or access to a team library)
- User should provide either:
  - A Figma file URL / file key to work in
  - Or context about which file to target (the agent can discover pages)
- Source code or description of the screen to build/update

#### Imported: Error Recovery

Follow the error recovery process from [figma-use](../figma-use/SKILL.md#6-error-recovery--self-correction):

1. **STOP** on error — do not retry immediately.
2. **Read the error message carefully** to understand what went wrong.
3. If the error is unclear, call `get_metadata` or `get_screenshot` to inspect the current file state.
4. **Fix the script** based on the error message.
5. **Retry** the corrected script — this is safe because failed scripts are atomic (nothing is created if a script errors).

Because this skill works incrementally (one section per call), errors are naturally scoped to a single section. Previous sections from successful calls remain intact.
