# Audio Transcribe

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `skills/.curated/transcribe` from `https://github.com/openai/skills.git` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Audio Transcribe Transcribe audio using OpenAI, with optional speaker diarization when requested. Prefer the bundled CLI for deterministic, repeatable runs.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Output conventions, Environment, Skill path (set once), CLI quick start.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Transcribe audio files to text with optional diarization and known-speaker hints. Use when a user asks to transcribe speech from audio/video, extract text from recordings, or label speakers in interviews or meetings.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Collect inputs: audio file path(s), desired response format (text/json/diarized_json), optional language hint, and any known speaker references.
2. Verify OPENAIAPIKEY is set. If missing, ask the user to set it locally (do not ask them to paste the key).
3. Run the bundled transcribe_diarize.py CLI with sensible defaults (fast text transcription).
4. Validate the output: transcription quality, speaker labels, and segment boundaries; iterate with a single targeted change if needed.
5. Save outputs under output/transcribe/ when working in this repo.
6. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
7. Read the overview, playbook, and source summary before loading any upstream support files.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Workflow

1. Collect inputs: audio file path(s), desired response format (text/json/diarized_json), optional language hint, and any known speaker references.
2. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set. If missing, ask the user to set it locally (do not ask them to paste the key).
3. Run the bundled `transcribe_diarize.py` CLI with sensible defaults (fast text transcription).
4. Validate the output: transcription quality, speaker labels, and segment boundaries; iterate with a single targeted change if needed.
5. Save outputs under `output/transcribe/` when working in this repo.

#### Imported: Dependencies (install if missing)

Prefer `uv` for dependency management.

```
uv pip install openai
```
If `uv` is unavailable:
```
python3 -m pip install openai
```

#### Imported: Output conventions

- Use `output/transcribe/<job-id>/` for evaluation runs.
- Use `--out-dir` for multiple files to avoid overwriting.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @transcribe to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/transcribe/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/transcribe/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @transcribe using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Default to gpt-4o-mini-transcribe with --response-format text for fast transcription.
- If the user wants speaker labels or diarization, use --model gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize --response-format diarized_json.
- If audio is longer than ~30 seconds, keep --chunking-strategy auto.
- Prompting is not supported for gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize.
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Decision rules

- Default to `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` with `--response-format text` for fast transcription.
- If the user wants speaker labels or diarization, use `--model gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize --response-format diarized_json`.
- If audio is longer than ~30 seconds, keep `--chunking-strategy auto`.
- Prompting is not supported for `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `skills/.curated/transcribe`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Reference map

- `references/api.md`: supported formats, limits, response formats, and known-speaker notes.

#### Imported: Environment

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set for live API calls.
- If the key is missing, instruct the user to create one in the OpenAI platform UI and export it in their shell.
- Never ask the user to paste the full key in chat.

#### Imported: Skill path (set once)

```bash
export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
export TRANSCRIBE_CLI="$CODEX_HOME/skills/transcribe/scripts/transcribe_diarize.py"
```

User-scoped skills install under `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (default: `~/.codex/skills`).

#### Imported: CLI quick start

Single file (fast text default):
```
python3 "$TRANSCRIBE_CLI" \
  path/to/audio.wav \
  --out transcript.txt
```

Diarization with known speakers (up to 4):
```
python3 "$TRANSCRIBE_CLI" \
  meeting.m4a \
  --model gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize \
  --known-speaker "Alice=refs/alice.wav" \
  --known-speaker "Bob=refs/bob.wav" \
  --response-format diarized_json \
  --out-dir output/transcribe/meeting
```

Plain text output (explicit):
```
python3 "$TRANSCRIBE_CLI" \
  interview.mp3 \
  --response-format text \
  --out interview.txt
```
