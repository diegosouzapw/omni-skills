# Slides

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `skills/.curated/slides` from `https://github.com/openai/skills.git` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Slides

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Recreate Or Edit Existing Slides.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Create and edit presentation slide decks (.pptx) with PptxGenJS, bundled layout helpers, and render/validation utilities. Use when tasks involve building a new PowerPoint deck, recreating slides from....
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Inspect the request and determine whether you are creating a new deck, recreating an existing deck, or editing one.
2. Set the slide size up front. Default to 16:9 (LAYOUT_WIDE) unless the source material clearly uses another aspect ratio.
3. Copy assets/pptxgenjs_helpers/ into the working directory and import the helpers from there.
4. Build the deck in JavaScript with an explicit theme font, stable spacing, and editable PowerPoint-native elements when practical.
5. Run the bundled scripts from this skill directory or copy the needed ones into the task workspace. Render the result with render_slides.py, review the PNGs, and fix layout issues before delivery.
6. Run slides_test.py for overflow checks when slide edges are tight or the deck is dense.
7. Deliver the .pptx, the authoring .js, and any generated assets that are required to rebuild the deck.

7. Deliver the `.pptx`, the authoring `.js`, and any generated assets that are required to rebuild the deck.

#### Imported: Overview

Use PptxGenJS for slide authoring. Do not use `python-pptx` for deck generation unless the task is inspection-only; keep editable output in JavaScript and deliver both the `.pptx` and the source `.js`.

Keep work in a task-local directory. Only copy final artifacts to the requested destination after rendering and validation pass.

#### Imported: Recreate Or Edit Existing Slides

- Render the source deck or reference PDF first so you can compare slide geometry visually.
- Match the original aspect ratio before rebuilding layout.
- Preserve editability where possible: text should stay text, and simple charts should stay native charts.
- If a reference slide uses raster artwork, use `ensure_raster_image.py` to generate debug PNGs from vector or odd image formats before placing them.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @slides to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/slides/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/slides/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @slides using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Validation Commands

Examples below assume you copied the needed scripts into the working directory. If not, invoke the same script paths relative to this skill folder.

```bash
# Render slides to PNGs for review
python3 scripts/render_slides.py deck.pptx --output_dir rendered

# Build a montage for quick scanning
python3 scripts/create_montage.py --input_dir rendered --output_file montage.png

# Check for overflow beyond the original slide canvas
python3 scripts/slides_test.py deck.pptx

# Detect missing or substituted fonts
python3 scripts/detect_font.py deck.pptx --json
```

Load `references/pptxgenjs-helpers.md` if you need the helper API summary or dependency details.

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Set theme fonts explicitly. Do not rely on PowerPoint defaults if typography matters.
- Use autoFontSize, calcTextBox, and related helpers to size text boxes; do not use PptxGenJS fit or autoFit.
- Use bullet options, not literal • characters.
- Use imageSizingCrop or imageSizingContain instead of PptxGenJS built-in image sizing.
- Use latexToSvgDataUri() for equations and codeToRuns() for syntax-highlighted code blocks.
- Prefer native PowerPoint charts for simple bar/line/pie/histogram style visuals so reviewers can edit them later.
- For charts or diagrams that PptxGenJS cannot express well, render SVG externally and place the SVG in the slide.

- Set theme fonts explicitly. Do not rely on PowerPoint defaults if typography matters.
- Use `autoFontSize`, `calcTextBox`, and related helpers to size text boxes; do not use PptxGenJS `fit` or `autoFit`.
- Use bullet options, not literal `•` characters.

- Use `latexToSvgDataUri()` for equations and `codeToRuns()` for syntax-highlighted code blocks.
- Prefer native PowerPoint charts for simple bar/line/pie/histogram style visuals so reviewers can edit them later.
- For charts or diagrams that PptxGenJS cannot express well, render SVG externally and place the SVG in the slide.
- Include both `warnIfSlideHasOverlaps(slide, pptx)` and `warnIfSlideElementsOutOfBounds(slide, pptx)` in the submitted JavaScript whenever you generate or substantially edit slides.
- Fix all unintentional overlap and out-of-bounds warnings before delivering. If an overlap is intentional, leave a short code comment near the relevant element.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `skills/.curated/slides`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
