# Security Ownership Map

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `skills/.curated/security-ownership-map` from `https://github.com/openai/skills.git` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Security Ownership Map

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Requirements, Output artifacts, LLM query helper, Basic security queries, Graph persistence, Notes.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Analyze git repositories to build a security ownership topology (people-to-file), compute bus factor and sensitive-code ownership, and export CSV/JSON for graph databases and visualization. Trigger only when the user....
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Scope the repo and time window (optional --since/--until).
2. Decide sensitivity rules (use defaults or provide a CSV config).
3. Build the ownership map with scripts/runownershipmap.py (co-change graph is on by default; use --cochange-max-files to ignore supernode commits).
4. Communities are computed by default; graphml output is optional (--graphml).
5. Query the outputs with scripts/query_ownership.py for bounded JSON slices.
6. Persist and visualize (see references/neo4j-import.md).
7. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Workflow

1. Scope the repo and time window (optional `--since/--until`).
2. Decide sensitivity rules (use defaults or provide a CSV config).
3. Build the ownership map with `scripts/run_ownership_map.py` (co-change graph is on by default; use `--cochange-max-files` to ignore supernode commits).
4. Communities are computed by default; graphml output is optional (`--graphml`).
5. Query the outputs with `scripts/query_ownership.py` for bounded JSON slices.
6. Persist and visualize (see `references/neo4j-import.md`).

By default, the co-change graph ignores common “glue” files (lockfiles, `.github/*`, editor config) so clusters reflect actual code movement instead of shared infra edits. Override with `--cochange-exclude` or `--no-default-cochange-excludes`. Dependabot commits are excluded by default; override with `--no-default-author-excludes` or add patterns via `--author-exclude-regex`.

If you want to exclude Linux build glue like `Kbuild` from co-change clustering, pass:

```bash
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/run_ownership_map.py \
  --repo /path/to/linux \
  --out ownership-map-out \
  --cochange-exclude "**/Kbuild"
```

#### Imported: Overview

Build a bipartite graph of people and files from git history, then compute ownership risk and export graph artifacts for Neo4j/Gephi. Also build a file co-change graph (Jaccard similarity on shared commits) to cluster files by how they move together while ignoring large, noisy commits.

#### Imported: Requirements

- Python 3
- `networkx` (required; community detection is enabled by default)

Install with:

```bash
pip install networkx
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @security-ownership-map-v2 to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/security-ownership-map-v2/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/security-ownership-map-v2/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @security-ownership-map-v2 using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick start

Run from the repo root:

```bash
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/run_ownership_map.py \
  --repo . \
  --out ownership-map-out \
  --since "12 months ago" \
  --emit-commits
```

Defaults: author identity, author date, and merge commits excluded. Use `--identity committer`, `--date-field committer`, or `--include-merges` if needed.

Example (override co-change excludes):

```bash
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/run_ownership_map.py \
  --repo . \
  --out ownership-map-out \
  --cochange-exclude "**/Cargo.lock" \
  --cochange-exclude "**/.github/**" \
  --no-default-cochange-excludes
```

Communities are computed by default. To disable:

```bash
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/run_ownership_map.py \
  --repo . \
  --out ownership-map-out \
  --no-communities
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- By default, the script flags common auth/crypto/secret paths.
- Override by providing a CSV file: # pattern,tag,weight /auth/,auth,1.0 /crypto/,crypto,1.0 */.pem,secrets,1.0 Use it with --sensitive-config path/to/sensitive.csv.
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Sensitivity rules

By default, the script flags common auth/crypto/secret paths. Override by providing a CSV file:

```
# pattern,tag,weight
**/auth/**,auth,1.0
**/crypto/**,crypto,1.0
**/*.pem,secrets,1.0
```

Use it with `--sensitive-config path/to/sensitive.csv`.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `skills/.curated/security-ownership-map`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Output artifacts

`ownership-map-out/` contains:

- `people.csv` (nodes: people)
- `files.csv` (nodes: files)
- `edges.csv` (edges: touches)
- `cochange_edges.csv` (file-to-file co-change edges with Jaccard weight; omitted with `--no-cochange`)
- `summary.json` (security ownership findings)
- `commits.jsonl` (optional, if `--emit-commits`)
- `communities.json` (computed by default from co-change edges when available; includes `maintainers` per community; disable with `--no-communities`)
- `cochange.graph.json` (NetworkX node-link JSON with `community_id` + `community_maintainers`; falls back to `ownership.graph.json` if no co-change edges)
- `ownership.graphml` / `cochange.graphml` (optional, if `--graphml`)

`people.csv` includes timezone detection based on author commit offsets: `primary_tz_offset`, `primary_tz_minutes`, and `timezone_offsets`.

#### Imported: LLM query helper

Use `scripts/query_ownership.py` to return small, JSON-bounded slices without loading the full graph into context.

Examples:

```bash
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out people --limit 10
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out files --tag auth --bus-factor-max 1
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out person --person alice@corp --limit 10
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out file --file crypto/tls
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out cochange --file crypto/tls --limit 10
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out summary --section orphaned_sensitive_code
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out community --id 3
```

Use `--community-top-owners 5` (default) to control how many maintainers are stored per community.

#### Imported: Basic security queries

Run these to answer common security ownership questions with bounded output:

```bash
# Orphaned sensitive code (stale + low bus factor)
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out summary --section orphaned_sensitive_code

# Hidden owners for sensitive tags
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out summary --section hidden_owners

# Sensitive hotspots with low bus factor
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out summary --section bus_factor_hotspots

# Auth/crypto files with bus factor <= 1
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out files --tag auth --bus-factor-max 1
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out files --tag crypto --bus-factor-max 1

# Who is touching sensitive code the most
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out people --sort sensitive_touches --limit 10

# Co-change neighbors (cluster hints for ownership drift)
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out cochange --file path/to/file --min-jaccard 0.05 --limit 20

# Community maintainers (for a cluster)
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/query_ownership.py --data-dir ownership-map-out community --id 3

# Monthly maintainers for the community containing a file
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/community_maintainers.py \
  --data-dir ownership-map-out \
  --file network/card.c \
  --since 2025-01-01 \
  --top 5

# Quarterly buckets instead of monthly
python skills/skills/security-ownership-map/scripts/community_maintainers.py \
  --data-dir ownership-map-out \
  --file network/card.c \
  --since 2025-01-01 \
  --bucket quarter \
  --top 5
```

Notes:
- Touches default to one authored commit (not per-file). Use `--touch-mode file` to count per-file touches.
- Use `--window-days 90` or `--weight recency --half-life-days 180` to smooth churn.
- Filter bots with `--ignore-author-regex '(bot|dependabot)'`.
- Use `--min-share 0.1` to show stable maintainers only.
- Use `--bucket quarter` for calendar quarter groupings.
- Use `--identity committer` or `--date-field committer` to switch from author attribution.
- Use `--include-merges` to include merge commits (excluded by default).

### Summary format (default)

Use this structure, add fields if needed:

```json
{
  "orphaned_sensitive_code": [
    {
      "path": "crypto/tls/handshake.rs",
      "last_security_touch": "2023-03-12T18:10:04+00:00",
      "bus_factor": 1
    }
  ],
  "hidden_owners": [
    {
      "person": "alice@corp",
      "controls": "63% of auth code"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Imported: Graph persistence

Use `references/neo4j-import.md` when you need to load the CSVs into Neo4j. It includes constraints, import Cypher, and visualization tips.

#### Imported: Notes

- `bus_factor_hotspots` in `summary.json` lists sensitive files with low bus factor; `orphaned_sensitive_code` is the stale subset.
- If `git log` is too large, narrow with `--since` or `--until`.
- Compare `summary.json` against CODEOWNERS to highlight ownership drift.
