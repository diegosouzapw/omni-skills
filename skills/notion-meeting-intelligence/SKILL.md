# Meeting Intelligence

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `skills/.curated/notion-meeting-intelligence` from `https://github.com/openai/skills.git` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Meeting Intelligence Prep meetings by pulling Notion context, tailoring agendas/pre-reads, and enriching with Codex research.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Prepare meeting materials with Notion context and Codex research; use when gathering context, drafting agendas/pre-reads, and tailoring materials to attendees.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Add the Notion MCP:
2. codex mcp add notion --url https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
3. Enable remote MCP client:
4. Set [features].rmcpclient = true in config.toml or run codex --enable rmcpclient
5. Log in with OAuth:
6. codex mcp login notion
7. Ask for objective, desired outcomes/decisions, attendees, duration, date/time, and prior materials.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Workflow

### 0) If any MCP call fails because Notion MCP is not connected, pause and set it up:
1. Add the Notion MCP:
   - `codex mcp add notion --url https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`
2. Enable remote MCP client:
   - Set `[features].rmcp_client = true` in `config.toml` **or** run `codex --enable rmcp_client`
3. Log in with OAuth:
   - `codex mcp login notion`

After successful login, the user will have to restart codex. You should finish your answer and tell them so when they try again they can continue with Step 1.

### 1) Gather inputs
- Ask for objective, desired outcomes/decisions, attendees, duration, date/time, and prior materials.
- Search Notion for relevant docs, past notes, specs, and action items (`Notion:notion-search`), then fetch key pages (`Notion:notion-fetch`).
- Capture blockers/risks and open questions up front.

### 2) Choose format
- Status/update → status template.
- Decision/approval → decision template.
- Planning (sprint/project) → planning template.
- Retro/feedback → retrospective template.
- 1:1 → one-on-one template.
- Ideation → brainstorming template.
- Use `reference/template-selection-guide.md` to confirm.

### 3) Build the agenda/pre-read
- Start from the chosen template in `reference/` and adapt sections (context, goals, agenda, owner/time per item, decisions, risks, prep asks).
- Include links to pulled Notion pages and any required pre-reading.
- Assign owners for each agenda item; call out timeboxes and expected outputs.

### 4) Enrich with research
- Add concise Codex research where helpful: market/industry facts, benchmarks, risks, best practices.
- Keep claims cited with source links; separate fact from opinion.

### 5) Finalize and share
- Add next steps and owners for follow-ups.
- If tasks arise, create/link tasks in the relevant Notion database.
- Update the page via `Notion:notion-update-page` when details change; keep a brief changelog if multiple edits.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @notion-meeting-intelligence to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/notion-meeting-intelligence/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/notion-meeting-intelligence/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @notion-meeting-intelligence using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick start

1) Confirm meeting goal, attendees, date/time, and decisions needed.
2) Gather context: search with `Notion:notion-search`, then fetch with `Notion:notion-fetch` (prior notes, specs, OKRs, decisions).
3) Pick the right template via `reference/template-selection-guide.md` (status, decision, planning, retro, 1:1, brainstorming).
4) Draft agenda/pre-read in Notion with `Notion:notion-create-pages`, embedding source links and owner/timeboxes.
5) Enrich with Codex research (industry insights, benchmarks, risks) and update the page with `Notion:notion-update-page` as plans change.

#### Imported: References and examples

- `reference/` — template picker and meeting templates (e.g., `template-selection-guide.md`, `status-update-template.md`, `decision-meeting-template.md`, `sprint-planning-template.md`, `one-on-one-template.md`, `retrospective-template.md`, `brainstorming-template.md`).
- `examples/` — end-to-end meeting preps (e.g., `executive-review.md`, `project-decision.md`, `sprint-planning.md`, `customer-meeting.md`).

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `skills/.curated/notion-meeting-intelligence`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.
