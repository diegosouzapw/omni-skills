# Netlify Deployment Skill

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `packages/skills-catalog/skills/(cloud)/netlify-deploy` from `https://github.com/tech-leads-club/agent-skills.git` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Netlify Deployment Skill Deploy web projects to Netlify using the Netlify CLI with intelligent detection of project configuration and deployment context.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Prerequisites, Authentication Pattern, Handling netlify.toml, Error Handling, Environment Variables, Tips.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Deploy web projects to Netlify using the Netlify CLI (npx netlify). Use when the user asks to deploy, host, publish, or link a site/repo on Netlify, including preview and production deploys. Do NOT use for deploying to....
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. ✅ Authenticated: Shows logged-in user email and site link status
2. ❌ Not authenticated: "Not logged into any site" or authentication error
3. Linked: Site already connected to Netlify (shows site name/URL)
4. Not linked: Need to link or create site
5. Choosing team/account
6. Setting site name
7. Configuring build settings

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Workflow

### 1. Verify Netlify CLI Authentication

Check if the user is logged into Netlify:

```bash
npx netlify status
```

**Expected output patterns**:

- ✅ Authenticated: Shows logged-in user email and site link status
- ❌ Not authenticated: "Not logged into any site" or authentication error

**If not authenticated**, guide the user:

```bash
npx netlify login
```

This opens a browser window for OAuth authentication. Wait for user to complete login, then verify with `netlify status` again.

**Alternative: API Key authentication**

If browser authentication isn't available, users can set:

```bash
export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

Tokens can be generated at: https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens

### 2. Detect Site Link Status

From `netlify status` output, determine:

- **Linked**: Site already connected to Netlify (shows site name/URL)
- **Not linked**: Need to link or create site

### 3. Link to Existing Site or Create New

**If already linked** → Skip to step 4

**If not linked**, attempt to link by Git remote:

```bash
# Check if project is Git-based
git remote show origin

# If Git-based, extract remote URL
# Format: https://github.com/username/repo or git@github.com:username/repo.git

# Try to link by Git remote
npx netlify link --git-remote-url <REMOTE_URL>
```

**If link fails** (site doesn't exist on Netlify):

```bash
# Create new site interactively
npx netlify init
```

This guides user through:

1. Choosing team/account
2. Setting site name
3. Configuring build settings
4. Creating netlify.toml if needed

### 4. Verify Dependencies

Before deploying, ensure project dependencies are installed:

```bash
# For npm projects
npm install

# For other package managers, detect and use appropriate command
# yarn install, pnpm install, etc.
```

### 5. Deploy to Netlify

Choose deployment type based on context:

**Preview/Draft Deploy** (default for existing sites):

```bash
npx netlify deploy
```

This creates a deploy preview with a unique URL for testing.

**Production Deploy** (for new sites or explicit production deployments):

```bash
npx netlify deploy --prod
```

This deploys to the live production URL.

**Deployment process**:

1. CLI detects build settings (from netlify.toml or prompts user)
2. Builds the project locally
3. Uploads built assets to Netlify
4. Returns deployment URL

### 6. Report Results

After deployment, report to user:

- **Deploy URL**: Unique URL for this deployment
- **Site URL**: Production URL (if production deploy)
- **Deploy logs**: Link to Netlify dashboard for logs
- **Next steps**: Suggest `netlify open` to view site or dashboard

#### Imported: Example Full Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check authentication
npx netlify status

# If not authenticated:
npx netlify login

# 2. Link site (if needed)
# Try Git-based linking first
git remote show origin
npx netlify link --git-remote-url https://github.com/user/repo

# If no site exists, create new one:
npx netlify init

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Deploy (preview for testing)
npx netlify deploy

# 5. Deploy to production (when ready)
npx netlify deploy --prod
```

#### Imported: Overview

This skill automates Netlify deployments by:

- Verifying Netlify CLI authentication
- Detecting project configuration and framework
- Linking to existing sites or creating new ones
- Deploying to production or preview environments

#### Imported: Prerequisites

- **Netlify CLI**: Installed via npx (no global install required)
- **Authentication**: Netlify account with active login session
- **Project**: Valid web project in current directory
- When sandboxing blocks the deployment network calls, rerun with `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`.
- The deployment might take a few minutes. Use appropriate timeout values.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @netlify-deploy to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/netlify-deploy/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/netlify-deploy/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @netlify-deploy using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Use the checklist, rubric, worksheet, and playbook together instead of relying on a single section in isolation.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `packages/skills-catalog/skills/(cloud)/netlify-deploy`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: Troubleshooting

### Escalated Network Access

If deployment fails due to network issues (timeouts, DNS errors, connection resets), rerun the deploy with escalated permissions (use `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`). The deploy requires escalated network access when sandbox networking blocks outbound requests.

Example guidance to the user:

```
The deploy needs escalated network access to deploy to Netlify. I can rerun the command with escalated permissions—want me to proceed?
```

#### Imported: Reference

- Netlify CLI Docs: https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/
- netlify.toml Reference: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/

#### Imported: Bundled References (Load As Needed)

- [Deployment patterns](references/deployment-patterns.md)
- [netlify.toml guide](references/netlify-toml.md)

#### Imported: Authentication Pattern

The skill uses the **pre-authenticated Netlify CLI** approach:

1. Check authentication status with `npx netlify status`
2. If not authenticated, guide user through `npx netlify login`
3. Fail gracefully if authentication cannot be established

Authentication uses either:

- **Browser-based OAuth** (primary): `netlify login` opens browser for authentication
- **API Key** (alternative): Set `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable

#### Imported: Handling netlify.toml

If a `netlify.toml` file exists, the CLI uses it automatically. If not, the CLI will prompt for:

- **Build command**: e.g., `npm run build`, `next build`
- **Publish directory**: e.g., `dist`, `build`, `.next`

Common framework defaults:

- **Next.js**: build command `npm run build`, publish `.next`
- **React (Vite)**: build command `npm run build`, publish `dist`
- **Static HTML**: no build command, publish current directory

The skill should detect framework from `package.json` if possible and suggest appropriate settings.

#### Imported: Error Handling

Common issues and solutions:

**"Not logged in"**
→ Run `npx netlify login`

**"No site linked"**
→ Run `npx netlify link` or `npx netlify init`

**"Build failed"**
→ Check build command and publish directory in netlify.toml or CLI prompts
→ Verify dependencies are installed
→ Review build logs for specific errors

**"Publish directory not found"**
→ Verify build command ran successfully
→ Check publish directory path is correct

#### Imported: Environment Variables

For secrets and configuration:

1. Never commit secrets to Git
2. Set in Netlify dashboard: Site Settings → Environment Variables
3. Access in builds via `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`

#### Imported: Tips

- Use `netlify deploy` (no `--prod`) first to test before production
- Run `netlify open` to view site in Netlify dashboard
- Run `netlify logs` to view function logs (if using Netlify Functions)
- Use `netlify dev` for local development with Netlify Functions
