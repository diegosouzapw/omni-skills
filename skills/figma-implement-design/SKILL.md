# Implement Design

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `packages/skills-catalog/skills/(design)/figma-implement-design` from `https://github.com/tech-leads-club/agent-skills.git` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

The packaged support pack adds a checklist, rubric, playbook, prompt template, router note, and source manifest so reviewers can audit the import as a complete workflow kit instead of a raw file dump.

# Implement Design

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Prerequisites, Common Issues and Solutions, Understanding Design Implementation.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Translate Figma nodes into production-ready code with 1:1 visual fidelity using the Figma MCP workflow (design context, screenshots, assets, and project-convention translation). Use when the user provides Figma URLs or....
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.
- Use when the support pack, checklist, rubric, and playbook should guide execution before touching code or tools.
- Use when the workflow should remain reviewable in the public intake repo before the private enhancer takes over.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `references/omni-import-playbook.md` | Establishes the workflow, review packet, and provenance expectations before work begins |
| PR review or merge readiness | `references/omni-import-rubric.md` | Turns the imported skill into a checklist-driven review packet instead of an opaque file copy |
| Source or lineage verification | `scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path quickly |
| Workflow execution | `references/omni-import-checklist.md` | Gives the operator the smallest useful entry point into the support pack |
| Handoff decision | `agents/omni-import-router.md` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Add the Figma MCP server to your agent's MCP configuration:
2. URL: https://mcp.figma.com/mcp
3. Enable remote MCP client if required by your agent.
4. Log in with OAuth following your agent's authentication flow.
5. File key: :fileKey (the segment after /design/)
6. Node ID: 1-2 (the value of the node-id query parameter)
7. URL: https://figma.com/design/kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF/DesignSystem?node-id=42-15

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Required Workflow

**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.**

### Step 0: Set up Figma MCP (if not already configured)

If any MCP call fails because Figma MCP is not connected, pause and set it up:

1. Add the Figma MCP server to your agent's MCP configuration:
   - URL: `https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`
2. Enable remote MCP client if required by your agent.
3. Log in with OAuth following your agent's authentication flow.

After successful login, the user will have to restart their agent. You should finish your answer and tell them so when they try again they can continue with Step 1.

### Step 1: Get Node ID

#### Option A: Parse from Figma URL

When the user provides a Figma URL, extract the file key and node ID to pass as arguments to MCP tools.

**URL format:** `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2`

**Extract:**

- **File key:** `:fileKey` (the segment after `/design/`)
- **Node ID:** `1-2` (the value of the `node-id` query parameter)

**Note:** When using the local desktop MCP (`figma-desktop`), `fileKey` is not passed as a parameter to tool calls. The server automatically uses the currently open file, so only `nodeId` is needed.

**Example:**

- URL: `https://figma.com/design/kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF/DesignSystem?node-id=42-15`
- File key: `kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF`
- Node ID: `42-15`

#### Option B: Use Current Selection from Figma Desktop App (figma-desktop MCP only)

When using the `figma-desktop` MCP and the user has NOT provided a URL, the tools automatically use the currently selected node from the open Figma file in the desktop app.

**Note:** Selection-based prompting only works with the `figma-desktop` MCP server. The remote server requires a link to a frame or layer to extract context. The user must have the Figma desktop app open with a node selected.

### Step 2: Fetch Design Context

Run `get_design_context` with the extracted file key and node ID.

```
get_design_context(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId="1-2")
```

This provides the structured data including:

- Layout properties (Auto Layout, constraints, sizing)
- Typography specifications
- Color values and design tokens
- Component structure and variants
- Spacing and padding values

**If the response is too large or truncated:**

1. Run `get_metadata(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId="1-2")` to get the high-level node map
2. Identify the specific child nodes needed from the metadata
3. Fetch individual child nodes with `get_design_context(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId=":childNodeId")`

### Step 3: Capture Visual Reference

Run `get_screenshot` with the same file key and node ID for a visual reference.

```
get_screenshot(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId="1-2")
```

This screenshot serves as the source of truth for visual validation. Keep it accessible throughout implementation.

### Step 4: Download Required Assets

Download any assets (images, icons, SVGs) returned by the Figma MCP server.

**IMPORTANT:** Follow these asset rules:

- If the Figma MCP server returns a `localhost` source for an image or SVG, use that source directly
- DO NOT import or add new icon packages - all assets should come from the Figma payload
- DO NOT use or create placeholders if a `localhost` source is provided
- Assets are served through the Figma MCP server's built-in assets endpoint

### Step 5: Translate to Project Conventions

Translate the Figma output into this project's framework, styles, and conventions.

**Key principles:**

- Treat the Figma MCP output (typically React + Tailwind) as a representation of design and behavior, not as final code style
- Replace Tailwind utility classes with the project's preferred utilities or design system tokens
- Reuse existing components (buttons, inputs, typography, icon wrappers) instead of duplicating functionality
- Use the project's color system, typography scale, and spacing tokens consistently
- Respect existing routing, state management, and data-fetch patterns

### Step 6: Achieve 1:1 Visual Parity

Strive for pixel-perfect visual parity with the Figma design.

**Guidelines:**

- Prioritize Figma fidelity to match designs exactly
- Avoid hardcoded values - use design tokens from Figma where available
- When conflicts arise between design system tokens and Figma specs, prefer design system tokens but adjust spacing or sizes minimally to match visuals
- Follow WCAG requirements for accessibility
- Add component documentation as needed

### Step 7: Validate Against Figma

Before marking complete, validate the final UI against the Figma screenshot.

**Validation checklist:**

- [ ] Layout matches (spacing, alignment, sizing)
- [ ] Typography matches (font, size, weight, line height)
- [ ] Colors match exactly
- [ ] Interactive states work as designed (hover, active, disabled)
- [ ] Responsive behavior follows Figma constraints
- [ ] Assets render correctly
- [ ] Accessibility standards met

#### Imported: Overview

This skill provides a structured workflow for translating Figma designs into production-ready code with pixel-perfect accuracy. It ensures consistent integration with the Figma MCP server, proper use of design tokens, and 1:1 visual parity with designs.

#### Imported: Prerequisites

- Figma MCP server must be connected and accessible
- User must provide a Figma URL in the format: `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2`
  - `:fileKey` is the file key
  - `1-2` is the node ID (the specific component or frame to implement)
- **OR** when using `figma-desktop` MCP: User can select a node directly in the Figma desktop app (no URL required)
- Project should have an established design system or component library (preferred)

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @figma-implement-design to handle <task>. Start with the workflow playbook, load only the upstream files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Inspect origin and import state

```bash
python3 skills/figma-implement-design/scripts/omni_import_print_origin.py
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need to confirm source repository, branch, commit, and path.

### Example 3: Review the support pack before execution

```bash
python3 skills/figma-implement-design/scripts/omni_import_list_support_pack.py
```

**Explanation:** This gives the operator a quick inventory of the imported references, examples, scripts, router notes, and manifest files.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @figma-implement-design using the checklist, rubric, playbook, and source manifest, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: Implementing a Button Component

User says: "Implement this Figma button component: https://figma.com/design/kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF/DesignSystem?node-id=42-15"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL to extract fileKey=`kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF` and nodeId=`42-15`
2. Run `get_design_context(fileKey="kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF", nodeId="42-15")`
3. Run `get_screenshot(fileKey="kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF", nodeId="42-15")` for visual reference
4. Download any button icons from the assets endpoint
5. Check if project has existing button component
6. If yes, extend it with new variant; if no, create new component using project conventions
7. Map Figma colors to project design tokens (e.g., `primary-500`, `primary-hover`)
8. Validate against screenshot for padding, border radius, typography

**Result:** Button component matching Figma design, integrated with project design system.

### Example 2: Building a Dashboard Layout

User says: "Build this dashboard: https://figma.com/design/pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D/Dashboard?node-id=10-5"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL to extract fileKey=`pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D` and nodeId=`10-5`
2. Run `get_metadata(fileKey="pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D", nodeId="10-5")` to understand the page structure
3. Identify main sections from metadata (header, sidebar, content area, cards) and their child node IDs
4. Run `get_design_context(fileKey="pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D", nodeId=":childNodeId")` for each major section
5. Run `get_screenshot(fileKey="pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D", nodeId="10-5")` for the full page
6. Download all assets (logos, icons, charts)
7. Build layout using project's layout primitives
8. Implement each section using existing components where possible
9. Validate responsive behavior against Figma constraints

**Result:** Complete dashboard matching Figma design with responsive layout.

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The checklist, rubric, worksheet, template, and playbook are there to make the import auditable, not to hide the source material.

- Place UI components in the project's designated design system directory
- Follow the project's component naming conventions
- Avoid inline styles unless truly necessary for dynamic values
- ALWAYS use components from the project's design system when possible
- Map Figma design tokens to project design tokens
- When a matching component exists, extend it rather than creating a new one
- Document any new components added to the design system

### Component Organization

- Place UI components in the project's designated design system directory
- Follow the project's component naming conventions
- Avoid inline styles unless truly necessary for dynamic values

### Design System Integration

- ALWAYS use components from the project's design system when possible
- Map Figma design tokens to project design tokens
- When a matching component exists, extend it rather than creating a new one
- Document any new components added to the design system

### Code Quality

- Avoid hardcoded values - extract to constants or design tokens
- Keep components composable and reusable
- Add TypeScript types for component props
- Include JSDoc comments for exported components

#### Imported: Best Practices

### Always Start with Context

Never implement based on assumptions. Always fetch `get_design_context` and `get_screenshot` first.

### Incremental Validation

Validate frequently during implementation, not just at the end. This catches issues early.

### Document Deviations

If you must deviate from the Figma design (e.g., for accessibility or technical constraints), document why in code comments.

### Reuse Over Recreation

Always check for existing components before creating new ones. Consistency across the codebase is more important than exact Figma replication.

### Design System First

When in doubt, prefer the project's design system patterns over literal Figma translation.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `packages/skills-catalog/skills/(design)/figma-implement-design`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use the support pack at all.
**Solution:** Re-open the checklist, playbook, source summary, and source manifest. Load only the upstream files that materially change the answer, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Use the operator packet and support-pack listing to point at the exact references, examples, scripts, and router notes that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the router note and related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Figma output is truncated

**Cause:** The design is too complex or has too many nested layers to return in a single response.
**Solution:** Use `get_metadata` to get the node structure, then fetch specific nodes individually with `get_design_context`.

### Issue: Design doesn't match after implementation

**Cause:** Visual discrepancies between the implemented code and the original Figma design.
**Solution:** Compare side-by-side with the screenshot from Step 3. Check spacing, colors, and typography values in the design context data.

### Issue: Assets not loading

**Cause:** The Figma MCP server's assets endpoint is not accessible or the URLs are being modified.
**Solution:** Verify the Figma MCP server's assets endpoint is accessible. The server serves assets at `localhost` URLs. Use these directly without modification.

### Issue: Design token values differ from Figma

**Cause:** The project's design system tokens have different values than those specified in the Figma design.
**Solution:** When project tokens differ from Figma values, prefer project tokens for consistency but adjust spacing/sizing to maintain visual fidelity.

#### Imported: Understanding Design Implementation

The Figma implementation workflow establishes a reliable process for translating designs to code:

**For designers:** Confidence that implementations will match their designs with pixel-perfect accuracy.
**For developers:** A structured approach that eliminates guesswork and reduces back-and-forth revisions.
**For teams:** Consistent, high-quality implementations that maintain design system integrity.

By following this workflow, you ensure that every Figma design is implemented with the same level of care and attention to detail.
